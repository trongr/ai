# Environment specific notes

On your local machine, enable tensorflow by running 

```
activate tensorflow
```

in the terminal.

If the terminal complains about 

```
UnicodeEncodeError: 'charmap' codec can't encode character '\xa9' in position 35: character maps to <undefined>
```

run 

```
chcp 65001
``` 

then rerun your script.
