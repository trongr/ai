How to install these programs
=============================

Assuming that you know how to use the Windows command prompt (cmd),
you will have to copy these programs to a Windows directory included
in the PATH. Unless you want to expand the PATH to include one or more
directories of your choosing, just do:

C:\Users\Username\abctools-win-VER> copy *.exe %SystemRoot%

Replace VER with the actual version number.
