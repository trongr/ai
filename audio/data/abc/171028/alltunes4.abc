%% This Dance is began by a single Person, (eithe Man or Woman) who taking a Cushion in their
%% Hand, dances about the Room, and at the End of the Tune they stop and sing, "This Dance it will
%% no farther go." The Musicians answer, "I pray, good Sir, why say you so?" Man, "Because Joan Sanderson
%% will not come too." Music. "She must come too, and she shall come too, and she must come whether
%% she will or no." Then he lays down the Cushion before a Woman, on which she kneels, and he
%% kisses her, singing,** "Prinkum prankum is a fine Dance, and shall we go dance it once again once
%% again, and once again, and shall we go dance it once again?" Then making a Stop, the Woman sings
%% as before, "This Dance &c." Music. "I pray you, Madam, &c." Woman "Because John Sanderson &c."
%% Music. "He must &c." And so she lays down the Cushion before a Man, who kneeling upon it
%% salutes her, she singing, "Welcome John Sanderson &c." Then he taking up the Cushion,
%% they take Hands and dance round, singing as before; and thus they do 'till the whole Company
%% are taken into the Ring. Then the Cushion is laid before the first Man, the Woman
%% singing, "This Dance &c." (as before) only instead of "come too", they sing "go fro"; and
%% instead of "Welcome, John Sanderson &c." they sing "Farewell John Sanderson, farewell,
%% farewell"; and so they go out one by one as they came in. Note, the Woman is kiss'd by
%% all the Men in the Ring at her coming in and going out, and likewise the Man by all
%% the Women.
%% -- Added note: (These words comes in at this mark * Welcome Joan Sanderson, welcome welcome: then she
%% rises, takes up the Cushion and both dance, singing [illegible])

N: The dance is in 4 sections, with two columns; ## used to mark the 2nd column.
N: A B-sharp in the last bar supports the idea that this was in D minor, with one flat, though the key signature is empty.
N: Should the last c have a sharp?  And both parts should obviously be repeated (each strain twice for its column).

N: The key signature has both high and low F-sharp, but only a high g-sharp without a low G-sharp.

N: DMDfD has a sharp before the low C sharp in bar 2 (written as B sharp); CCDM1 lacks this sharp.

N: The natural in the base voice's bar 4 was missing, but it's obviously needed.
N: CCDM2 says "Each Strain but once", but has repeat signs in the music.
N: CCDM2's dance is missing the first "& turn", but is the same otherwise (except for capitalization).
N: The tunes differ only in bar 3; the lower notes are from CCDM2.

N: The 2nd phrase has a begin repeat but no end repeat.
N: Repeats added to satisfy the "Each Strain twice" instruction.
N: The D.C. at the end seems superfluous; the dance seems to be 32 bars long.
N: Perhaps the tune was meant to be played AABA?  Or maybe the dance should end in the middle?
N: The tied notes are single 3-count notes in CCDTB, two notes in CCDM2.
N: The first halves of the dances are different; the second halves are the same.
