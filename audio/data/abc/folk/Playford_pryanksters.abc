H:flowers, once grew plentifully of its hillsides but was stripped away

T:Chestnut
T:Doves Figary
H:The tune is reminiscent today of the first phrase of "God rest ye

H:of luck-visit songs, wassails, harvest suppers, may carols and their
H:parodies, 'chestnut' having feminine symbolism. The second title may
H:be expalined by Deloney's ballad of 1600 on Dove's roguery with the
H:women. Although it is an awkward fit, repeating the last words of some
H:lines might make it work.

T:Hearts Ease
R:jig
H:There are two distinct tunes named "Heartsease" and considerable
H:differences of opinion as to whether any of the known lyrics fit either
H:of them. The earliest lyric is "a songe to the tune of hartes ease"
H:from Thomas Richardes' play on an Italian model, called "Misogonus" (c.
H:1560). Although it scans well, the text is arranged in short verses
H:which would only use half the dance tune, implying that an earlier tune
H:by this name may have had only one strain.
H:
H:Richard Dering's catch "Cries of London" is set to the A strain.
H:
H:Hearts-ease in 16th century herbal culture was the little wild pansy, known
H:today as Johnny-jump-up. It was also called "Love in Idleness".

H:This short-lived dance may be associated with Shirley's popular play

H:stage, probably for the race scene in the fourth act. He was not much

H:source of dubious authenticity itself.
H:__ Came you not from Newcastle? __

H:Duke of Newcastle, a royalist who remained in London and bent
H:his interests towards the theatre during the interregnum.

T:Sta(i)nes Morris
H:First printed in the "William Ballet Lute Book" (1595). It is not known
H:that the town of Staines, on the Thames, had any connection with this tune.
N:Morris-dance tune.
N:There is much disagreement over which e's should be flat or natural. Older
N:books all show Eb throughout, but this could just be an result of using "proper"
N:classical notation. Current practice seems to be to play it mostly in Dorian
N:mode.
